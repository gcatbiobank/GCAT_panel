# Merge SNV outputs by sample  

In this section we combine by sample the outputs of Deepvariant, Haplotype Caller and Strelka2 applying a co-occurrence method (Logical method), considering an SNV as True Positive (PASS), if it is detected at least by two variant callers. The strategy to merge callers by sample and filtering applied can be found in Supplementary material [sections 8.2 and 8.4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453041v1) respectively.  

The script "merge_callers_SNVs.R" is used to merge Deepvariant, Haplotype Caller and Strelka2 VCF outputs. This script requires the following libraries:  
library(data.table)  
library(dplyr)  
library(rlang)  
library(R.utils)  

The script requires different inputs:  
#### 1- The strategies used by variant callers to detect the genetic variability (example found in input/strategies.csv)  
#### 2- A list of samples which we performed the variant calling (example found in input/samples)  
#### 3- The variant caller outputs for each sample (example of each variant caller output AFTER preprocessing can be found in inputs/Deepvaraint, GATK, Strelka2 respectively)  

The script is executed as follows:  
##### Rscript merge_callers_SNVs.R 10 1  

Where the first argument is the chromosome (10), and second argument (1) is the first sample of ./inputs/samples list file. It is important create the same name file as example presented in this demo, otherwise the merge_callers_SNVs.R code have to be modified. These strategies allows to parallelise the merge by sample and chromosome. We recommended follow the same folder structure presented here to execute the R script, otherwise, the R code should be modified.
